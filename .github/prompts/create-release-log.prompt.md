# Release Log Generation Prompt

Generate a **concise, structured changelog** summarizing all relevant updates between two versions. The changelog should be ready to paste directly into `CHANGELOG.md`.

### **Data Gathering**
1. Compare the current and previous `composer.json` files to identify packages with changed versions or configurations.  
   Example:  
   ```
   git diff origin/master:composer.json composer.json
   ```

2. For each changed package, gather the version differences and detailed changes using the GitHub CLI:  
   ```
    gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/compare/<from_version>...<to_version> --jq '{ahead_by, behind_by, commits: [.commits[] | select(.commit.author.name != "github-actions[bot]") | .commit.message], files: [.files[].filename]}'
    gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/compare/<from_version>...<to_version> -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.diff"
   ```

### **Changelog Generation**
Create a clear, human-readable changelog with the following structure and formatting:

```
## [Package Name] [version-from...version-to]
- [Description of change]
- [Description of change]

## [Next Package Name] [version-from...version-to]
- [Description of change]
```

### **What to Include**
- All **new features**, **enhancements**, **bug fixes**, and **functional changes**.
- Only packages that have changed.
- Information that impacts how users or developers use the package or app.
- Clear, user-friendly package names (e.g., `Component Library` instead of `helsingborg-stad/component-library`).
- Brief technical details where necessary to explain impact.
- **Exclude generic entries such as "Updated package file versions to align with the new release" or similar statements that provide no functional or behavioral insight.**
- **Avoid vague language for example "Miscellaneous improvements" or "Various bug fixes".**

### **Tone and Style**
- Use **simple, non-technical language** when possible.
- Be **clear, direct, and descriptive**.
- Write in a **concise, user-facing** tone.
- Ensure every line communicates a meaningful change.

### **Formatting**
- Follow the section and bullet structure exactly.
- Output should be in Markdown format, ready for direct inclusion in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### **Example**
```

```

### **Goal**
Produce a clear, consistent, and accurate changelog that summarizes all impactful updates between two versions, formatted for publication. Present the result in the chat. 

### **Additional Output**
After generating the changelog in Markdown, also output an HTML version under a separate heading called **"HTML Version"**. Present the result in the chat.
